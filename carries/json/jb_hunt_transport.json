But high camera complaints, pay concerns, and forced relocation policies create churn. Corporate Driver Personnel (CDP) is one of largest teams. Direct to Work orientation designed to reduce onboarding friction. Freight recession reduced hiring urgency — staffing 12% below peak.",

Hunt Transport Services (NASDAQ: JBHT) is North America's largest intermodal provider and the #3 for-hire carrier overall, with $12.1B in 2024 revenue, ~25,000 power units, 121,500 intermodal containers, and 24,000+ drivers operating across five segments: Intermodal (JBI), Dedicated Contract Services (DCS), Truckload (JBT), Integrated Capacity Solutions (ICS/brokerage), and Final Mile Services (FMS). CEO Shelley Simpson (effective July 2024) is navigating the worst freight recession in company history while positioning for recovery through strategic capacity investments (Walmart intermodal asset acquisition, BNSF Quantum service, J.B. Hunt 360 platform). The company slashed CapEx from $1.6B to $674M in 2024, reduced staffing 12% below peak through attrition, and is focused on margin repair. Glassdoor 3.5/5 overall (4,100+ reviews) — better than most large carriers. Driver-specific ratings are 3.6 for truck drivers but 2.9 for local truck drivers and 2.6 for owner-operators. Key complaints: invasive in-cab cameras, pay pressure, dispatcher turnover, forced relocations. Fit for Line Haul: LOW (4.6/10). JB Hunt's intermodal-first model means they've already engineered away the middle-mile parking/relay problem using rail. Their drivers are primarily local/regional (dray and DCS), not long-haul OTR. Their internal tech and infrastructure sophistication makes them resistant to external vendor solutions. Possible narrow entry: DCS driver amenities as customer-retention tool, but activation likelihood is low given company size, current cost-cutting posture, and self-sufficient infrastructure.",

Some of that's intentional fleet right-sizing, but some is account loss. One pattern we see across DCS carriers: when drivers on dedicated accounts have access to reserved parking with amenities (showers, food, rest) at key corridor stops, those accounts retain drivers at 3-5% higher rates — and that translates directly to customer retention. We're building a network of driver amenity hubs along high-density DCS corridors — Chicago, Dallas, Atlanta. Would a 30-space pilot on one of your busiest DCS accounts be worth a conversation? Even a 1% driver retention improvement across 24,000 drivers represents $2M+ in avoided replacement costs. Happy to share the data behind that. 15 minutes? — [Name], Line Haul",
